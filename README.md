# React + TypeScript + Vite Portfolio Website

Initially I generated the template using Vite. 

I began customizing it by removing unecessary template objects and images. I added my resume download link at the top. The user simply clicks to download the latest resume file.

Then I added flip cards to display the image and name of my projects and on the flip side, their details, technologies used, and links.

The CSS styling, colors and images were all curated by me. The layout was designed to work for my three current projects on a standard 1920p screen but also works for a thinner screen size. 

It will be possible to add/remove projects in the future as needed.
